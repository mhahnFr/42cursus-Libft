# Welcome to 42cursus-Libft!
This library is the result of the very first project at the 42school. The task
is to recode some functions of the libc library as well as some other utility
functions. The subject of the additional bonus part is to create some utility
functions for the use of linked lists. After coding all these functions, one
has an indepth understanding of the basics of strings in C.

## Purpose of the repository
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my solutions. Although you can use
this library, I would recommend to stick to the standard functions of C, as they
are much more optimized for their current use.

## Usage
If you wish to use the library, simply use the makefile that is provided in the
``src`` directory of this repository.

### Final notes
This repository will not be developed further. If you have any questions, feel
free to send me a message.
