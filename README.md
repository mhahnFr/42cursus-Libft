# Welcome to 42cursus-Libft!
This library is the result of the very first project at the
[42 school]. The task is to recode some functions of the ``libc`` library as
well as some other utility functions. The subject of the additional bonus part
is to create some utility functions for the use of linked lists. After coding all
these functions, one also has an indepth understanding of the basics of strings in C.

## Purpose of the repository
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my solutions. Although you can
use this library, I would recommend to stick to the standard functions of C, as
they are much more optimized for their current use.

## Usage
If you wish to use the library, simply use the makefile that is provided in the
``src`` directory of this repository.

### Final notes
Some other utility functions might be appended later on.

> As all other C projects at the [42 school], the code has to written in accordance
> with the [norm]:  
> - Only 25 lines per function,
> - only 5 functions per file,
> - usage of only the allowed external functions.
